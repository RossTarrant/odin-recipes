# odin-recipes
In this project, I created a basic recipe website as part of the Odin Project. Prior to completing this project I spent time learning about creating basic HTML structure and learning about the different tags that can be used to style a page and I also spent some time learning about CSS and how it can be used to style an HTML page.

This project uses _some_ of the following HTML tags that I have been learning abouts. Tags such as:
- The **_HTML/Body/Head_** tags to create the structure of the page.
- Text elements such as **_p, h1, h2, ul, li_**.
- Styling tags such as **_b, em_**.
- The **_img_** tag to insert an image.
- **_link_** tag to link the styles CSS file to the page.

As well as the HTML elements, I spent some time learning about and practicing CSS.
I learned about and implemented key concepts such as:
- How to structure a CSS file and link it into a HTML page.
- Using CSS Selectors to target specific content _**e.g. IDs, Classes and Elements**_.
- Properties of elements_** e.g. background-color, font-weight, font-color**_.
- Pseudo-classes for HTML elements such as **_'hover'_**.

In conclusion, this project was a great exercise to help me practice piecing together some of the basic concepts I have been learning, together in one project. I think my end product, while basic, demonstrated that I had a grasp on these basic concepts and I look forward to further practicing these in future exercises/projects.
